    <h3>Life Story:</h3>
    <p>As a 6 year old, I began to realize what being a good student meant.  
    Having a good eduacation meant that I would live a life that I would want to have.  
    At 7 years old I didn't live a fun year.  
    For the most part, I learned ahead of my second grade classmates to be prepared for third. 
    The next year kept doing the same as I had.  Preparing and earning the good grades that I deserved.  
    At nine, I started to realize how boring shopping could be,
    because my mom always forced me on her 2 hour trip to South Coast just to 
    either go to Macy's or Victoria's Secret.  
    When I grew a year older I began to mature more and actually grow way taller.  
    At this age I reflected back at the time when my sister told me 
    I would never be taller than her.  
    I laughed and saw how short she was while she tried to chug gallons of milk 
    hoping to become taller.  At 11, I was in my last year of elementary.  
    It became one of the most memorable years as we celebrated our last day.  
    It was sad and happy as I was ready for middle school.  
    Through my last two years I struggled for the first year but soon adapted 
    to the new enviroment and teachers.  Obviously for my 8th grade year I only 
    was afraid of high school.  Now I am here, inches away from becoming a freshman.</p>
