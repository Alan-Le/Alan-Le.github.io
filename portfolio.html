      <h1>Description:</h1>
      <p>The galaxy is being threatened by enemies of the darkness.
      You are a guardian, born to protect space and spread light across
      the universe. The scoring system will accumalate your score based
      on how many enemies you kill. Random enemies will appear and the 
      difficulty will increase as more enemies spawn in different planets.
      Because your ghost will resurrect you, it is very difficult for a 
      guardian to die.</p>
      <h1>Reflection:</h1>
      <p>Before high school, I played a game called "Destiny". I enjoyed it
      as I was able to play with 5 other people in different activities.
      Because I enjoyed so much of the game, I decided to try and replicate
      it on Scratch, which was not easy.  Some successful points include
      the loading the screen and animations while also utilizing a randomizer
      for the enemies. Obstacles included the change of sound when travelling
      to different locations. We weren't able to fix the issue, but we have
      found a temporary solution which is to play a different sound after
      the previous sound has ended. Another obstacle was the 300+ costumes
      of the loading screen that did not fit. In order to make the loading
      screen look professional, I matched the colors of the backdrop with the
      loading screen itself.  If I had more time, I would add more locations,
      more enemies, and improve the animations of the game.</p>

      <p>You are a famous scientist who recently made headlines for developing a
      cure for cancer and many other diseases. However, the cure was deemed
      deadly and would kill all known living cells on Earth. You have once chance
      to save it.</p>

      <p>
      We first started by creating a google drawing that included a flow chart
      of all of our scenes. We had many issues, such as deciding on how the 
      story will end or what type of mood the story will be. However, by
      simplfying the plot and making a understandable ending, we resolve our
      conflict on how our story will play out. Our program was created by
      using similar functions that would call on the next scene to play, which
      would develop an entire story. This is an example of procedural abstraction
      because it would allow the story to continuously play. A delay in the
      typing speed would mean for example a new day has started. I particularly
      enjoyed stories like Dr. Suess for it was simple which helped me change our
      story to make it simpler. Another story I liked was Geronimo Stilton since
      the plot was very interesting and was the first book that I actually enjoyed.
