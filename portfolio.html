      <h1>Description:</h1>
      <p>The galaxy is being threatened by enemies of the darkness.
      You are a guardian, born to protect space and spread light across
      the universe. The scoring system will accumalate your score based
      on how many enemies you kill. Random enemies will appear and the 
      difficulty will increase as more enemies spawn in different planets.
      Because your ghost will resurrect you, it is very difficult for a 
      guardian to die.</p>
      <h1>Reflection:</h1>
      <p>Before high school, I played a game called "Destiny". I enjoyed it
      as I was able to play with 5 other people in different activities.
      Because I enjoyed so much of the game, I decided to try and replicate
      it on Scratch, which was not easy.  Some successful points include
      the loading the screen and animations while also utilizing a randomizer
      for the enemies. Obstacles included the change of sound when travelling
      to different locations. We weren't able to fix the issue, but we have
      found a temporary solution which is to play a different sound after
      the previous sound has ended. Another obstacle was the 300+ costumes
      of the loading screen that did not fit. In order to make the loading
      screen look professional, I matched the colors of the backdrop with the
      loading screen itself.  If I had more time, I would add more locations,
      more enemies, and improve the animations of the game.</p>
